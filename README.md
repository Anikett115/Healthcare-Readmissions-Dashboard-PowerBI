# 🏥 Healthcare Readmissions Dashboard – Power BI

## 🎯 Business Problem

Hospitals face significant financial and operational challenges due to high patient readmission rates.  
Unplanned readmissions increase healthcare costs, strain hospital resources, and often indicate gaps in care quality.

This project aims to:
- Identify hospitals with unusually high readmissions
- Analyze relationships between infections, admissions, and mortality
- Track year-over-year trends to support healthcare policy and operational decisions

## 📂 Dataset
- Simulated healthcare clinical data
- Includes hospital ID, admission dates, readmissions, infections, deaths, and length of stay
- Data cleaned and transformed using SQL and Power Query

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Hospitals with higher infection counts tend to show higher readmission rates
- Certain hospitals consistently outperform others in managing readmissions
- Specific years show spikes in admissions and mortality, indicating possible policy or operational changes
