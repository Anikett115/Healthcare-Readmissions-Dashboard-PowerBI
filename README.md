#  Healthcare Readmissions Dashboard – Power BI

##  Business Problem

Hospitals face significant financial and operational challenges due to high patient readmission rates.  
Unplanned readmissions increase healthcare costs, strain hospital resources, and often indicate gaps in care quality.

This project aims to:
- Identify hospitals with unusually high readmissions
- Analyze relationships between infections, admissions, and mortality
- Track year-over-year trends to support healthcare policy and operational decisions

##  Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Healthcare Readmissions Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **DAX**.  
The dashboard analyzes hospital-level clinical data to identify trends in **readmissions, admissions, infections, and mortality**, helping stakeholders make data-driven healthcare decisions.

---

##  Business Objective
- Identify hospitals with high readmission rates
- Analyze infection trends and their impact on readmissions
- Track yearly patterns in admissions and mortality
- Support hospital administrators in improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency

##  Dashboard Pages

###  Hospital Analysis
- Total Admissions by Hospital
- Total Readmissions by Hospital
- Total Infections by Hospital
- Total Deaths by Hospital
- Hospital-level comparisons using interactive visuals

###  Analysis by Year
- Year-wise trends for admissions, readmissions, infections, and deaths
- Identification of peak and low-performing years
- Trend analysis to support long-term planning

---

##  Key KPIs
- **Readmission Rate**
- **Total Admissions**
- **Total Infections**
- **Total Mortality**
- **Year-over-Year Trends**

##  What I Did

- Designed and populated a simulated healthcare dataset using SQL
- Performed data cleaning and transformations in Power Query
- Created DAX measures for KPIs such as readmission rate, total admissions, and mortality
- Designed interactive dashboards with slicers and drill-downs
- Published the report to Power BI Service and enabled secure sharing

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop & Power BI Service**
- **SQL Server**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query**
- **Data Modeling & Relationships**

### 📊 Data Profiling & Quality Checks
- Automated column-level profiling using dynamic SQL
- Computed statistical metrics (min, max, mean, median, mode, SD)
- Identified nulls, zero values, and data distribution patterns
- Used metadata-driven logic to profile all columns generically

---

##  Dataset
- Simulated healthcare clinical data
- Includes hospital ID, admission dates, readmissions, infections, deaths, and length of stay
- Data cleaned and transformed using SQL and Power Query

---

##  Key Insights
- Hospitals with higher infection counts tend to show higher readmission rates
- Certain hospitals consistently outperform others in managing readmissions
- Specific years show spikes in admissions and mortality, indicating possible policy or operational changes
  
---

##  Business Impact

- Enables hospital administrators to identify high-risk hospitals and focus on quality improvement initiatives
- Supports data-driven decisions to reduce readmissions, optimize resource utilization, and improve patient outcomes
